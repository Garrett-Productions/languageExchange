in this component my goal is to make this as inviting as I can. 
I want this to mimic the UI of my Dive Project and modern UI

Im going to stack components or bring in props so I can create a scroll feature, maybe I can actually use the CSS from Dive shop as far as sepearyon of concerns go

I want a nav bar, a main display, an inside the community where I user feedback, an FAQ section and a footer, maybe test with an API with cool photos from around the world?
