Chat App Idea
1. I could follow this 2 week, video a day tutrrial and deploy a MERN chat app. That would be huge, give me a great experience incorporating Socket.io with MERN
2. Then go create it in my language with Flask.

10/27 Notes
- re wire-frame first
* Goal is to deploy and be professional.
* The Project 
1. group chat room capabilities with functionality to be able to drop a chat room and get into another one.
2. API info from a language teacher, maybe world news, or language API - reserach langauge API functionality
3. I want to incorpororate all joins that I've done in all my exams in one way or other. Ill keep redoing my DB idc, I'll ensure I pinpoint each one in the wireframe itself
4. Watch a socket.io tutorial with flask and mysql, and the n from there incorporare socket into my language exchange 
5. Im gonna need to find API videos with SQL, maybe watch an AJAX tutorial first.

BIG STEPS
1. Rebuild wireframe(where all my joins and chat rooms are laid out)
2. Watch 2 tutorials, First: Socket.io with flask & mysql... Second: later on, AJAX and API's(platform)
3. Profile Picture capability
3. Refactor build with TailwindCSS.
4. Start building brother
5. Deploy as biggest project to date.
6. Maintain on AWS and keep open source
